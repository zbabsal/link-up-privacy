    </ul>

    <h3>Automatically Collected Data:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Precise Geographical Location (GPS):</strong> Collected only with your explicit consent, due to the core functionality of our App (displaying nearby Links and creating location-based Links). You reserve the right not to share your location, but some essential features may be limited.</li>
      <li>App usage statistics (duration of time spent, Links clicked, profiles viewed, search queries, and interaction statistics).</li>
      <li>Your IP address, device model, operating system, language settings, mobile network information, and unique device identifiers.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. How We Use Your Data</h2>
    <p>We use the data we collect for:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Service Provision:</strong> Managing your LinkUp accounts and providing basic services.</li>
      <li><strong>Location-Based Matching:</strong> Displaying nearby Links.</li>
      <li><strong>Personalization:</strong> Offering personalized Link suggestions.</li>
      <li><strong>Security and Compliance:</strong> Preventing fraud, complying with laws.</li>
      <li><strong>Application Development Purposes.</strong></li>
    </ul>

    <h2>4. Data Sharing and Disclosure</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>We <strong>do not sell or rent</strong> your personal data to anyone.</li>
      <li><strong>User Visibility:</strong> The Links you create, your profile information, and the Reactions you give to Links may be visible to other LinkUp users depending on your application settings. Your precise location is <strong>not directly displayed</strong> on your profile.</li>
      <li><strong>Third-Party Service Providers:</strong> Data may be shared with third-party service providers (hosting, analytics) we use to support the operation of the App.</li>

      Your location data may be kept in a generalized format after the service is provided and is not directly linked to your identity.
      <strong>You can withdraw your location sharing permission at any time through your device's settings.</strong>
    </p>
